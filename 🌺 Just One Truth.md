## 💌 Just One Truth… For You, Arya 🌸

**Hey...**

Some feelings don’t ask to be understood —  
they just wish to **breathe** 💭

What I share — in **words**, in **silences**, in **songs whispered between hours** —  
is not to impress you, not to move you...  
but simply because **it’s real** 🤍

🌿 **It’s love** —  
not the dramatic kind,  
just something **soft**,  
like **rain** that falls without asking if the earth is ready ☔🌱

And yes, let me say this... **gently**, just once:

🕊️ **I know** — not “think,” but truly **know** —  
**that nothing will ever happen between us.**  
I’ve accepted that.  
**Completely.**

But if I don’t let this love express itself,  
it turns heavy — not because of **you**,  
but because of **me** 💔

So here it is — not to change anything,  
but to stay true to what **lives inside me** ❤️‍🔥

💌 A quiet love —  
the kind that asks for **nothing**,  
but glows anyway...  
like a candle that keeps burning even when no one's watching 🕯️✨

If someday, by life’s strange poetry...  
something real stirs —  
it will feel like a **dream written long ago** 🦋🌙

But even if not...

Know this:

🌹 You were **loved**,  
**softly**, **deeply**, **endlessly** —  
without needing to know.  
Without needing to **say yes.**  
Without needing to even **see** it.

☀️ **Always,  
Yours in stillness.**
