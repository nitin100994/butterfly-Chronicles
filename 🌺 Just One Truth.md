## 🌸 Just One Truth... For You

Hey...

Some feelings don’t ask to be understood —  
they just wish to breathe.

What I share — in words, in silences, in songs between hours —  
is not to impress you, not to move you,  
but simply because it’s real.

🌿 It’s love.  
Not the dramatic kind —  
just something soft,  
like rain that falls without asking if the earth is ready.

And yes,  
let me say it gently, just once:

🕊️ I know — not think, but know —  
that nothing will ever happen between us.  
I’ve accepted that.  
Completely.

But if I don’t let this love express itself,  
it turns heavy — not because of you,  
but because of me.

So here it is — not to change anything,  
but to stay true to what lives within me.

💌 A quiet love,  
the kind that asks for nothing,  
but glows anyway.

If someday, by life’s strange poetry,  
something real stirs —  
it will feel like a dream written long ago.

But even if not...  
know this:

You were loved,  
softly, deeply, endlessly —  
without needing to know.

☀️ Always,
Yours in stillness.
