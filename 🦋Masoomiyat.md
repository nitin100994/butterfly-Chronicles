# 🦋 Chapter: MLM & Masoomiyat — A Butterfly’s Guide to Escaping the Glitter Trap


---

## 🧶 Let Me Tell You a Funny, Slightly Painful Story...

Hey you,

Yes, *you*. The one who smiles mysteriously and secretly wants to rule the world *without selling her soul* (or her LinkedIn integrity 😛).

This isn’t aimed at anyone, okay? I'm just talking to the air… *coughs Pooja coughs*... I mean, just a butterfly in general. 🦋

Let’s talk about MLM — not the lipstick brand, but **Multi-Level Madness.**

---

## 😂 What is MLM, Really?

MLM stands for **Multi-Level Marketing**. But bro, in reality, it’s:

> "Matlab Logon se paisa nikalna."

It’s like a shaadi invitation —

* Everyone looks dressed up.
* Food smells good.
* Aunties are excited.
* But you know there’s one uncle trying to sell you insurance at the buffet. 🍛😒

## 🎭 How The Trap Starts — One Message at Midnight

It begins with something like:

> "Hey, long time! I found a business opportunity I think you’ll love 💸💼."

Or worse:

> "Sir/mam, earn ₹7500 per hour from home. No skills needed, just dreams 😎."

(You know who liked that post two years ago? Haha, wait, I promised I won't point fingers. Let’s just say... LinkedIn never forgets 😬)

They ask you to:

1. Join their “mission.” 🚀
2. Invest a bit — maybe ₹5k, maybe ₹50k.
3. Then bring others in.

It’s not a job. It’s *social networking with financial blackmail.*

---

## 📈 Explained Like We’re in a Math Class (But Cool)

* You join.
* You bring 5 friends.
* They bring 5 each = 25.
* Then 125.
* Then 625.
* Then...

You need **more people than there are in your entire pincode** just to break even.

This is not income. It’s **income tax without income**. 😭

## 🧨 Realization: The Handsome Trap

At first, they *do* pay you. Just enough to make you think:

> "Arey wah! I'm a businesswoman now."

But that’s the bait. Like when I got free ice cream once and then paid ₹600 for a gym protein that tasted like chalk. 😒

Same vibes.

## 🔍 How I Know? Bro, I’ve Been There

You know me — I don’t claim things without data (because I have none 😅). But I’ve felt that weird gut pull when someone starts behaving *just slightly off* — like they’re talking to you but calculating your network in their head.

I’m not saying you did anything like that. Not even hinting.

I’m saying **if** you ever get into something fishy —

> **Just ask yourself: Why am I here? What changed after Day 1?**

And if it *smells* like pressure, *looks* like shine, and *feels* like stress…

🚨 Baby, that’s not a business. That’s a trap with a brochure.

## ❤️ Final Butterfly Note

So why am I saying all this?
Because...

* Maybe you’ve already figured this out. (High five 🫶)
* Or maybe you’ll never fall for this. (Even better!)
* Or maybe, just maybe, *you did stumble once*, and this helps you rise softer.

I’m writing not because I doubt you — but because I **don’t want you to doubt yourself later.**

You know me:

> Always speculating, always overthinking, and always trying to protect the flower even if I don’t know if there’s a storm. 🌸

So if this helped, amazing. If you already knew this — then **damn, we’re aligned.**
And if you ever get lost, just know I’ll be around with memes, chai, and a really sarcastic police complaint template.
