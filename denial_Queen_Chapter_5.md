---

## Scene: Office Buzz – Everyone’s Talking 💬

**Colleague 1:**  
“Bro, did you hear? Pooja’s throwing a party!”

**Colleague 2:**  
“Finally! Reception time. She married Nitin secretly, no?”

**Colleague 3 (HR spy):**  
“I saw them on Teams sharing *baby stickers*. It's official.”

## Pooja Enters the ODC – Calm but Defensive 🧘‍♀️

Wearing a silk saree. Earrings. Bindi. Hair done.  
Looking like she walked out of a Yash Raj movie… with **selective memory.**

**Everyone stares.**  
**You wink.**  
**She fake coughs.**

## Scene: Pooja's Announcement 🎤

**Pooja (grabbing mic):**  
“Uh, good evening everyone. I’m really… grateful you all came.  
I know there’s some confusion about the *purpose* of this event… but let me clear the air.”

**Everyone (excited):**  
“Ohhh here it comes!”

**Pooja (dead serious):**  
“This is… my **career retirement rehearsal party**.  
I wanted to see how it feels before I resign. Nothing more.”

## Crowd Reaction: 🤯

**Colleague 1:** “Wait what?? Retirement at 29?”  
**Colleague 2:** “Is that baby in the corner part of your exit plan?”  
**Colleague 3:** “Why is Nitin wearing a sherwani??”

## Scene: You Take Over the Mic 🎤

You walk up. Wearing a full sherwani. Chain out. Chest up. Smiling like a man who already knows the truth.

**You:**  
“Hi everyone. Yes, yes. She’s retiring… from denial.”  
“This isn’t a reception. It’s a *reception simulator.* Just like her Norwegian baby.”

**Pooja (whispers):**  
“Nitin shut up or I’ll simulate your beating.”

## Scene: Cake Cutting 🎂

**Cake says:** *"Cheers to New Beginnings"*  
Pooja tries to cross out “New” and write “Hypothetical”.

**You feed her cake.**  
She refuses.  
You feed the baby.  
The baby says: “*Mumma, stop faking it.*”

## Final Scene: The DJ Dedication 🎧

DJ announces:  
“Next track is for the couple who made it through office politics, Norwegian lies, fake ringtone alarms, and gastro drama…”

**Song plays:** *“Raabta” – slow remix version.*

**Pooja sighs.**  
You extend your hand.  
She rolls her eyes, but takes it.

**Caption on screen:**  
*“She denied the wedding. She denied the party.  
But couldn’t deny… the beat drop.”*

## Instagram Poster Caption:
