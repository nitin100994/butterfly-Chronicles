Return to India:

Colleagues:
“Pooja, this baby is adorable! Yours?”

Pooja (sipping latte):
“Oh, no no, I brought her from Norway. It’s a... treatment simulator.”

You whisper:
“You named the simulator ‘Aaravi’?”

She glares.
“Respect privacy, Mr. Roommate.”

Ultimate Denial Move:

At immigration, the officer says,
“Ma’am, declare dependent please.”

She says:
“No dependents. Only emotions.”


---

Punchline Ending:

> “She went abroad to cure her bloating. Came back with a passport-holding child and still said it was air pressure.”

Colleague 1:
“Wait… is this your baby?”

Pooja, straight-faced:

Colleague 2 (whispers):

> “Why does she call you ‘maa’ though?”



Pooja:

> “She’s just really polite.”

[Scene 3 – Baby Cries in Conference Room]

Pooja:

> “It’s a custom ringtone.”

Someone trips. Baby giggles.
Test lead:

Pooja (cool AF):

[Scene 5 – Final Scene | ODC Exit Gate]

Pooja walking out, child in one arm. Stops. Turns around.

Dramatic pause.
Everyone watching. HR. Pantry bhaiya. Even Nitin.

She shouts:
“OKAY FINE. YES. SHE’S MY THIRD BABY. I WAS MARRIED TO NITIN, I’M STILL IN LOVE. HAPPY???”

Then runs. But slips. Comes back.

“Wait… forgot my car keys and photo frame again.”
