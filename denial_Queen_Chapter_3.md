Pooja in Denial: Baby’s Day Out – ODC Edition

(a reel concept with transitions, music, and captions)


---

[Scene 1 – ODC Entry | Song: “Laung Da Lashkara” fade-in]
Pooja enters ODC in a formal kurta. AirPods in. Baby in one arm. Diaper bag on the other.

Caption:

> “Back to work. Just a little gas issue left to handle.”




---

[Scene 2 – Cafeteria Chatter]
Colleague 1:
“Wait… is this your baby?”

Pooja, straight-faced:

> “No yaar, my Norwegian friend sent her for cultural exposure.”



Colleague 2 (whispers):

> “Why does she call you ‘maa’ though?”



Pooja:

> “She’s just really polite.”




---

[Scene 3 – Baby Cries in Conference Room]
Pooja to manager:

> “Sorry, that’s my… um… Bluetooth speaker alarm.”



Manager (confused):

> “Why’s it saying ‘I want mamma’?”



Pooja:

> “It’s a custom ringtone.”




---

[Scene 4 – Baby crawling near testing team | Background track: "Tom & Jerry theme"]

Someone trips. Baby giggles.
Test lead:

> “Pooja, the baby is chewing on the test scripts!”



Pooja (cool AF):

> “Well, she’s part of the QA team now.”

[Scene 5 – Final Scene | ODC Exit Gate]

Pooja walking out, child in one arm. Stops. Turns around.

Dramatic pause.
Everyone watching. HR. Pantry bhaiya. Even Nitin.

She shouts:
“OKAY FINE. YES. SHE’S MY THIRD BABY. I WAS MARRIED. I’M STILL IN LOVE. HAPPY???”

Then runs. But slips. Comes back.

“Wait… forgot my car keys and photo frame again.”
