🛎️ Pooja Chronicles – Operation: Gotcha...

🌟 Scene: The Day We Finally Met

After years of butterflies, glances, silence, Insta captions, divine masculine energies, and chaotic office politics…
She walks in.
Arya.
The girl I renamed with stardust.
The girl who never said yes…
but always said yes. 🧠🪮

🍜 Phase 1: The Lassi Laughathon

We meet. We laugh. Non-stop. 🤣😂
I swear bro, we talked like two idiots who forgot the world was spinning. 🚀🌌
Lunch? Mandatory. 😋🍛
Some dal makhni later, we’re full of food and foolishness. 🍽️🥲
She wipes her mouth. I wipe my tears. 😥🤭
Tears of laughter, mostly. (Maybe a little love too.) 💖

🚗 Phase 2: The Hotel Plot Twist

On the way back to office, we pass the legendary Sandal Suites – by Lemon Tree 🍋
I turn to her, look deep into her soul and say:

> “Let’s go to a hotel.” 😮😉



Her heart skips a beat. 💓
Chaya appears in the sky like a censor board member. 🎥👩‍📝
Pooja’s brain: “WAIT. WHAT DID HE JUST SAY?” 🤯🤦
Me: 😇 “Just trust me…” 🩸

🔐 Phase 3: The Nap Trap

We walk in.
She looks around, nervous. 😳😟
Room 186. 🛎️

We enter. I act fast.  🚅
Snatch her phone 📱 like a thief in love.  🙈💕
Push her to bed (gently, respectfully, like an HR-friendly K-drama hero).  🛏️✨
Switch on AC ❄️
Draw the curtains 🌙
Place a bottle of lassi by the bedside 🧃
Lock the door from outside 🔐
Smile like a child who just solved P vs NP. 🧒🧮🎓

> "Sleep, Pooja.
Finally.
Sleep like you were meant to —
phone-less, chaos-less, gang-less." 🥴🛌🌔

> Some girls want dinner.
Some want roses.
Mine?
She just needs a freaking nap.

✨ Afterword

> No kisses.
No cuddles.
Just silence and safety.
That’s how I show love:
In silly jokes and sacred naps._ 😍🌠
