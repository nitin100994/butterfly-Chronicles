# 🏠 3:45 PM: The Pooja That Wasn't
---

## 🎧 Scene Open – The Dancing Girl

*Camera pans inside a sunlit room.*

There she is – **Pooja** – twirling like a cotton candy tornado 🍭 in her comfy shorts and oversized tee, grooving to *“Just The Way You Are”* by Bruno Mars 🎶💃🏽. Her hands? Moving like she's doing bhangra. Her feet? Some wild mix of breakdance, Garba, and accidental kathakali. And her face? Smiling like a child who just stole chocolate from the fridge.

Earphones in. Volume max. She’s in her own world 🌍❤️.

Suddenly—

**“Poojaaaa! Zara idhar aana zara!”** 

Maa’s voice pierces through her perfect pirouette. She jumps, fake-annoyed. 

“Coming, mom! One sec!” she yells, half-laughing, still dancing, hair flying like she’s in a shampoo ad 🌪️💁🏽‍♀️.

## 🚪 Scene 2 – The Walk of Wholesome Disaster

Her mom repeats:

**“Beta, koi milne aaya hai… dost hoga shayad.”**

Her eyes sparkle. Who!? Surprise? A gift? 😳🎁

She grabs her phone, adjusts her t-shirt like a champ, and walks toward the door…

> Slow-mo: Hair flowing, dupatta doing physics-defying moves, phone in hand like Gen-Z queen. Wind is doing more drama than needed 🌬️🎀.

Background song switches to *“Love Me Like You Do”*. The timing is divine. The universe conspires. 

She approaches the gate… earphones still in… eyes on phone… then 👀👀

**BOOM. It’s Nitin.**

She freezes. Face turns tomato red 🍅. 

Heart does somersaults 🤸🏽‍♀️.

## 🏃‍♀️ Scene 3 – The Escape Artist

And then… **RUN**. Full Usain Bolt mode activated ⚡.

Back to her room. Door slammed. Curtains drawn. Phone THROWN 💥📱. She’s hiding behind her bed like there’s a lion at the gate.

## 📞 Scene 4 – The Cover-up Call

She calls her mom from her room 📞:

> **“Maa… bas kehdo na ki main busy hoon… puja kar rahi hoon ya kuch bhi bol do!”**

Mom, now confused but playing along:

> “Beta, woh toh keh raha hai ki ID card dena tha… Arya ka naam liya… tumhara toh nahi.”

Pooja whispers, horrified: 😢 kya karu mai inka... 👀 

> “Maa he’s playing with us… just cover-up!”

## 👩‍🦳 Scene 5 – Aunty's Realization

Now camera shifts to *Maa*. Eyes squint. Brain activates. **She knows.**

> *Wait… he asked for Arya, not Pooja…? He’s teasing me too?? Yeh toh pakka plan hai.*

Maa’s expression: A mix of shock 🧠🔥.

She turns to him and says sweetly:

> “Beta, woh puja kar rahi hai. 😷 Actually thoda sick bhi hai… stomach gas… allergy… bahar ka kahti rehti hai...” 🤐🤒

Meanwhile, Nitin, outside the gate, smirks, looks at his watch pooja at this time 😲, nonetheless...

After 30 minutes of laughing and joking with aunty — while Pooja called over 10 times, one of which aunty forgot to cut — she ended up hearing us talk and laugh like long-lost friends. 😅📞💬


> **“It’s 3:45 PM. And she’s doing puja?”** he chuckles silently. Okay aunty 😏 🕺🕶️.

## 🎬 Post Credits – Dramatic Internal Monologue (Pooja’s Room)

Under her blanket, Pooja whispers to herself:

> **“Why did I run!? Ughhh Arya you idiot… he saw you… HE DEFINITELY SAW YOU.”**

Cuts to her checking his Insta again 👀.

New post: 
> **"3:45. She’s doing puja. Sure. 🤭🧿"**

*She blushes. Pillow slammed to face.*
