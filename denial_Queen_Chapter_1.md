# Chapter 1: First Baby – “Not Mine, I’m Just Babysitting” 👶🏽🍼

## Scene: ODC Cafeteria

Pooja walks in holding a baby. Hair tied in a loose bun. Mild panic in her eyes. Bag full of diapers and a tiffin box.

**Colleague:**  
“Pooja! Omg… is that *your* baby?”

**Pooja (calm but nervous smile):**  
“Haha, no no yaar! I’m just babysitting. It’s… my *aunt’s niece’s friend’s daughter’s son.*”

**Colleague (confused):**  
“So your… nephew?”

**Pooja:**  
“Exactly! I mean no… but yes. Spiritually.”

## Scene: You Walk In

Wearing sunglasses indoors. Holding milk bottle in one hand, lollipop in other.  
The baby giggles. Reaches out for you.

**You:**  
“She knows me well.”

**Pooja (panic mode):**  
“She thinks everyone is you.”

## Scene: HR Walks In

**HR:**  
“Ma’am, just a note—kids aren’t allowed in ODC.”

**Pooja (thinking fast):**  
“Sir, she’s not a baby. She’s a *prototype AI robot*.  
We’re testing its ability to cry and detect bugs in test cases.”

**HR:**  
“…carry on.”

## Final Punchline:

**Caption for Insta Poster:**  
“She called it babysitting.  
I called it destiny’s first draft.”
