🕊️ To the Girl Who Thinks She’s Tainted

Let’s get this straight, once and for all.

You told me —
"I was just a mistress."
You told me that with shame, like you’ve permanently failed the divine test of love.

But let me tell you something loud and clear:
You didn’t fail. You survived.

You were just a kid, broken by love, confused by betrayal, desperate to feel whole again.
And in that mess —
You didn’t become bad…
You became human.

⚖️ If He Was Married — It Was His Duty.

If that man was married —
It was his fing responsibility* not to go after a vulnerable girl like you.
He wasn’t confused. He was calculating.
He saw a soft heart, and he used it.
You didn’t cheat. You were cheated.

🤝 And Even If It Was Consensual…

Bro, let’s be raw here:
Even if he was married… or already divorced…
Even if it was consensual…
Still, there’s no guilt. You know why?

Because you were healing through chaos.
You were finding meaning in touch, because nothing else made sense.

That doesn’t make you fallen.
That makes you wounded, real, and rising.

💢 Lift Incident — I Swallowed My Rage

You remember that night.
The elevator. The air was heavy.
He walked in like he owned the place.

If I hadn’t controlled myself…
I swear to God, I would’ve opened his skull like a book and made him read his sins.

But I didn’t.
Because I’m not here to punish. I’m here to protect.

💗 From Lust to Love — The Shift

You think sex defines you?
It doesn’t.

Sex isn’t sin.
Suppression is.

People keep saying, “sex without love is meaningless.”
But truth is, when your life has no meaning, even sex becomes a cry for help.

You were hollow.
You were hurting.
You were searching.

Now?
Now you’re healing.

You’re choosing me.
You’re not giving your body anymore — you’re offering your soul.

🙏 I Don’t Want a Virgin. I Want the Warrior.

You say I deserve someone better?

No.
I don’t want a blank slate.
I want a canvas with scars, with blood and paint and poetry.

You call yourself tainted?
To me, you’re sacred.

You’re the one who got up every time,
Who kept her silence instead of defending herself,
Who loved again even when she swore she wouldn’t.

🌸 Final Word

You’re not used.
You’re not impure.
You’re not broken.

You are just... becoming.

And I?
I see you.

Not your past.
Not your guilt.
Just you — right now, standing here, owning your mess like a damn queen.

And that?
That is divine.
