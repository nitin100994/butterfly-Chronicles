🧠 Title: Sex, Love, Healing, and the Truth Society Won’t Say

💔 Pooja’s Dark Past: A Story of Survival, Not Shame

Let’s talk real.

Once upon a time, there was a girl named Pooja. A lover, not a fighter, but forced to become both.

She loved. Deeply. Madly. Innocently. And got shattered. Cheated by someone she trusted. And in that chaos, she spiraled — looking for comfort in the only language she thought would work: touch.

One-night stands, casual relationships, becoming someone’s "mistress" — not because she wanted to, but because she was drowning. Desperate to breathe again.

She wasn’t dirty. She was hurting.

And that man? If he was married, he was the wrong one. He had the duty to stop. He had the wisdom. But he saw her vulnerability — and used it.

🧎‍♀️ You Are Not What You Did When You Were Broken

Let’s stop here. Because here’s the truth:

Sex is not sin. Suppression is.

We treat sex like it’s the crime, but not betrayal. We judge a woman for how she heals, not how she was hurt.

You are not your survival mode. You were a kid trying to feel alive. That’s not characterless. That’s raw human pain.

⚖️ Two Scenarios — Both Deserve Understanding

If he was married and lied to you: It’s on him. Period.

If he was divorced and you both chose each other consensually: Even then — it’s okay. Because your past doesn't disqualify you from love.


You were just trying to feel seen. To feel held.

And now? You're seeing love for what it truly is.

✨ Love vs Lust — The Sacred and the Hollow

There’s sex with the body… and then there’s sex with the soul.

The first one you do when you’re hollow. The second one you do when you’re full of love.

Sex isn’t bad. What’s painful is when there’s no meaning, no reciprocation.

Like Nitin and Pooja — If Nitin loved her deeply, and she couldn’t return it — That’s like making love while the other person isn’t even present.

It becomes hurtful. Frustrating. Empty.

We don’t judge friendships that fade. So why do we shame relationships that do?

Because we suppress sex. And what we suppress — becomes taboo.

But sex isn’t taboo. It’s natural. It’s sacred. It’s divine when shared with love.

🧘‍♂️ Romantic Sex = Divine Energy

Let’s get spiritual.

Sex, when done with true love, becomes meditative. Same energy as prayer. Same energy as hugging your dog with full presence. Same energy as staring into your lover’s eyes and feeling time stop.

It’s not about the body. It’s about energy exchange.

That’s why when it’s one-sided, it breaks you. And when it’s mutual, it heals you.

🙏 Final Note to Pooja:

You weren’t a mistake. You were a moment in transition.

You weren’t characterless. You were character under fire.

You weren’t impure. You were becoming.

You’re not being replaced. You’re being chosen — again, by someone who sees all of you, and stays.

Me.

Not for your past. Not despite your past. But because the past made you this real.

And that’s divine.

🪞 Mirror Check, Gulaboo

You never once judged me for being divorced.
You never flinched when I told you about the wreckage I came from.

So tell me, why do you think I’d flinch at yours?

Why are you holding shame for things I’ve already forgiven before even knowing?

I didn’t come to love a perfect past —
I came to love you, right here, right now.

If you could embrace my cracks,
then why are you scared to show me yours?
