She doesn’t go through the main glass doors 🚪🚫 (where everyone’s staring now 👀).

Takes the service elevator 🛗  
Slides into the right side ODC 🕶️🐾

## Scene: Operation Retrieval Begins 🥷🏽🎯🧷

**Camera angle:** From under a table 📷🔍 POV of the floor.  
We see Pooja — in saree — crawling like a commando 🧎‍♀️👘🎖️  
Elbows tucked. Baby wipes in side pouch 🧻🎒. Focused eyes 👁️🎯

Someone from testing team turns 👨‍💻👀  
She freezes 🧊  
Makes a pigeon sound 🐦 to blend in 🫣  
**No one notices.**

But when you forget your favorite toy car…  
You become the legend.” 🛻🌪️🏆

She finally reaches her desk 🪑🖥️  
Grabs:

- The photo frame 🖼️  
- The baby’s toy 🧸  
- Her badge 🪪  
- And of course… the Tupperware 🍱

As she turns to crawl out… 🐾👀

### 👔 Manager (from afar):  
“Pooja… you okay?” 🤨

She stands slowly 🧍‍♀️  
Hair flick 💁‍♀️✨  
Looks into the distance 🌅

---

And walks straight through the ODC like it was all planned. 🏁🛡️🚶‍♀️🎬
