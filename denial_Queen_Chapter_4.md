Finale Sequence: “The Return of the Denier” – ODC Sneak Attack Mode


---

Scene: After her big confession and dramatic exit

She yells from the main gate:
"Fine! I'm married to Nitin. We have THREE kids. Okay?? Bye!"
[Emotional orchestral music in the background]

Suddenly she stops. Eyes wide.

Turns to you, whispering:
"Sh*t. Photo frame... toy car... charger... milk bottle… and my badge."

You:
“So… want me to get it?”

Pooja:
“No. If I declared war… I retrieve my flag.”

Scene: Entering ODC again... but not like before.

She doesn’t go through the main glass doors (where everyone’s staring now).
No, no.

She circles around.
Takes the service elevator.
Slides into the right side ODC.

Scene: Operation Retrieval Begins

Camera angle: From under a table, POV of the floor.
We see Pooja — in saree — crawling like a commando, elbows tucked, baby wipes in her side pouch, focused eyes.

Someone from testing team turns around.
She freezes under a chair.
Makes a pigeon sound to blend in.
No one notices.

Voiceover (you):

> “When love fails...
Denial takes over.
But when you forget your favorite car toy…
You become the legend.”




---

Scene: The Mission is Complete

She finally reaches her desk.
Grabs the photo frame, the baby’s toy, the badge, and her Tupperware.

As she turns to crawl out...

Manager’s voice from afar:
“Pooja… you okay?”

She stands up slowly.
Looks into the distance.
Hair flick. Drama.
“Never better.”

And walks straight through the ODC like it was all planned.

> “She denied love. She denied babies.
But she couldn’t deny… her Tupperware.”
