## Scene: After Her Big Confession & Dramatic Exit

**Pooja (yelling from main gate):**  
"FINE! I'm married to Nitin. We have THREE kids. Okay?? Bye!"  
*(Emotional orchestral music swelling in background 🎻)*

**Suddenly she stops. Eyes wide.**

**Pooja (whispers):**  
"Sh*t. Photo frame… toy car… charger… milk bottle… and my badge."

**You:**  
“So… want me to get it?”

**Pooja (firm):**  
“No. If I declared war… I retrieve my flag.”

## Scene: Entering ODC Again… But Not Like Before 🔥

She doesn’t go through the main glass doors (where everyone’s staring now).  
**No, no.**

She circles around.  
Takes the *service elevator.*  
Slides into the *right side ODC.*

## Scene: Operation Retrieval Begins 🥷🏽

**Camera angle:** From under a table, POV of the floor.  
We see Pooja — in saree — crawling like a commando.  
Elbows tucked. Baby wipes in side pouch. Focused eyes.

**Someone from testing team turns. She freezes.**  
Makes a *pigeon sound* to blend in.  
**No one notices.**

## Voiceover (You): 🎙️  
> *“When love fails... Denial takes over.  
But when you forget your favorite toy car…  
You become the legend.”*

## Scene: The Mission is Complete ✅

She finally reaches her desk.  
Grabs:  
- The **photo frame**  
- The **baby’s toy**  
- Her **badge**  
- And of course… the **Tupperware**

**As she turns to crawl out...**

**Manager (from afar):**  
“Pooja… you okay?”

**She stands slowly.  
Hair flick. Looks into the distance.**  
**Pooja (dramatic AF):**  
“Never better.”

*And walks straight through the ODC like it was all planned.*

## Instagram Caption for Poster Drop:

**“She denied love.  
She denied babies.  
But she couldn’t deny…  
her Tupperware.”**
