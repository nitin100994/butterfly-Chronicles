# 🌌 **The Search I Never Planned** 🚗💫

> _You know what it feels like sometimes?_  
Like you’re waiting for me somewhere…  
at a place I’ve never been to,  
📍 with no phone, no way to call—  
📵 just standing there… trusting I’ll find you. 🙇‍♂️💞

## 🚘 **And me?**

I wake up at **3 a.m.** 🌃  
heart racing like I’m already late  
to pick you up.  
But the truth is—  
I don’t even know where to go.  
🛣️ I don’t know where you are.  
And that unknown…  
it **burns.** 🔥💔

## 🔑 **The Drive of Faith**

Can you hear me? 🗣️💭  
I’ve already picked up my car keys 🗝️,  
walking toward the car with no GPS,  
already driving,  
searching for you—  
but I don’t know **where**. 🚘🌫️

And still...  
I’m on the journey.  
Not knowing where it began,  
not knowing where it ends.  
Because maybe—  
just maybe—  
**that’s life.** 🚶‍♂️🌌

A journey we don’t fully understand.  
A search for something that  
**feels like home** 🏡,  
even when we’ve never been there.  
Even when we’re not sure  
if we’re meant to arrive.  
But we still drive.

## 💫 **For You, Always**

So if you’re somewhere out there,  
with no phone,  
but hope in your eyes—  
I just want you to know:  
💗 I’m coming.  
💭 I may not know the road,  
but my soul remembers you.  
And maybe…  
that’s enough.
