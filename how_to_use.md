### For Her (How to Use This App)

1. Open the private link I gave you in **Safari**
2. Tap the **Share icon** → Scroll → Tap **“Add to Home Screen”**
3. You’ll see the app icon appear — tap it like any app
4. That’s it. No login needed. Just stories, only for you.

**Optional (if you want real-time alerts):**
When asked for **notification permission**, tap **Allow**

You’ll get a ping whenever a new story is posted —  
or you can just check it like a ritual.

No pressure. Just presence.
