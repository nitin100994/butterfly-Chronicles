# Soul Whisperer

**A private Progressive Web App (PWA)** designed for one-way emotional storytelling.  
Built with Flutter + Firebase, this app delivers quiet digital moments — from one soul to another — without the noise of traditional platforms.

> "Some words aren't meant to be spoken. They're meant to be seen — once, silently."
