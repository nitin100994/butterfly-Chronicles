# 🌞✨ Truth Can’t be drawn – A Reflection by Nitin Joshi

> “I don’t remember her features.  
> I remember her *presence*.”

I know her...  
Not like an artist knows a face,  
But like a monk knows silence.  
I remember how she *smiles*,  
How her aura changes the temperature of a room,  
How her silence feels louder than a thousand voices.  
But if you ask me to draw her—  
To describe her lips, the curve of her nose, even her eyes...  
I can’t.

I don’t even know if she wears mascara.  
And I think that’s the most beautiful part.

Because I never *looked at* her like the world does.  
**I didn’t observe her — I *absorbed* her.** 💫  
She wasn’t an image to memorize.  
She was a *truth* to experience.

## 🕉️ The Osho Realization:

Osho once said:  
> **“You cannot draw the truth. You can only experience it.”**

That sentence shattered everything I knew about love, beauty, and perception.

Let’s say I tell you:  
> “Nature is truth.” 🌿

Am I saying *truth*?  
Or am I just *talking about* it?

Like the sun... ☀️  
We can try to define it—  
But its truth lies in how it warms our skin,  
Not in how we describe its glow.

So when I say I knew her,  
I didn’t mean I could *define* her.  
I meant I could *feel* her.

## 🌌 What She Was To Me:

> **I didn’t look at her. I experienced her.**  
> I didn’t remember features—I remembered *feelings.*  
> I didn’t capture her image—I absorbed her energy.  
> Just like nature,  
Just like the wind,  
Just like truth...

She wasn’t meant to be seen—  
She was meant to be *felt.* ❤️‍🔥

## 🦋 Final Whisper

So no, I can’t describe her lashes, her lips, her eyeliner...  
But I can describe the **stillness** I felt when she stood near.  
The calm. The pull. The poetry.  
And maybe that’s what love really is.

> A truth you cannot draw—  
> Only dissolve into.
