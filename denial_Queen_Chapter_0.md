# Chapter 0: The Secret Marriage – “15 Days, 1 Husband, 0 Clarity” 💍🕵️‍♀️  
*(Set: One year before the first baby was spotted in the ODC 👶🏽🏢)*

---

## Scene: Exactly one year ago... 🗓️⏳

Pooja suddenly applies for a **15-day leave** 📝🏃‍♀️.

**No out-of-office mail. No announcement.** Just... *poof* 💨.

Everyone assumes: family function 🕯️, vacation 🌴, maybe yoga retreat in Kerala 🧘‍♀️.

## Meanwhile on Instagram... 💫📲

She casually posts a mehendi pic ✋🌿.

**Caption:**  
“Letting go of control... and embracing the flow.” 🌊  
(zoom in: *‘N’ shaped mehendi design* 🔍✍️)

Then another pic:  
Wearing a bridal lehenga in front of a decorated mandap 👰🎊.  
**Caption:** *“Red is just a color… unless it's fate.”* ❤️🔮

**Colleague DM’d her:**  
“Wait… was that YOUR wedding??” 💬😲

**Pooja:**  
*“Haha no yaar, cousin ki shaadi thi. I just love dressing up!”* 💅👗  
**Next story:** meme: *“Mind your own business challenge: Level unlocked.”* 🧠🔒😎

## Return to Office: 15 Days Later ⏳🏢

- Slight sindoor trace 🔴  
- Mangalsutra peeking through her kurta 🔗🧣  
- Emergency contact in HR records now says: **Nathan Wright** 🧑‍💼📋

**Everyone suspicious** 🤔👀  
But she keeps saying:  
*“It was just a destination family event. Nothing serious.”* 🌴🧘‍♀️🚫💍

## Behind the scenes... 🎭📞

**You (hearing her whisper on phone):**  
“Nathan, I’m in the middle of sprint planning 🧑‍💻. Yes, I took my vitamins 💊. No, I won’t name the baby ‘Jupiter’.” 🍼🌌

You walk in 🚶‍♂️  
She cuts the call ✂️📴

**You (grinning):** 😏  
“So... still a ‘family event’?”

**Pooja:**  
“Nitin please. This isn’t Shark Tank. Stop pitching theories.” 💼📉🎤

## Final Caption 🎬

She left for 15 days 🧳💨  
Came back with a new surname 🪪, a spiritual glow ✨, and a contact named **Nathan Wright** 📱

But still told the ODC she was on a **‘healing journey.’** 🕊️🌿
