# Chapter 0: The Secret Marriage – “15 Days, 1 Husband, 0 Clarity” 💍🕵️‍♀️  
*(Set: One year before the first baby was spotted in the ODC)*

## Scene: Exactly one year ago...

Pooja suddenly applies for a **15-day leave**.

**No out-of-office mail. No announcement.** Just... *poof*.

Everyone assumes: family function, vacation, maybe yoga retreat in Kerala.

## Meanwhile on Instagram... 💫

She casually posts a mehendi pic.

**Caption:**  
“Letting go of control... and embracing the flow.”  
(zoom in: *‘N’ shaped mehendi design*)  

Then another pic:  
Wearing a bridal lehenga in front of a decorated mandap.  
**Caption:** *“Red is just a color… unless it's fate.”*

**Colleague DM’d her:**  
“Wait… was that YOUR wedding??”

**Pooja:**  
*“Haha no yaar, cousin ki shaadi thi. I just love dressing up!”*  
**Next story:** meme: *“Mind your own business challenge: Level unlocked.”*

## Return to Office: 15 Days Later ⏳

- Slight sindoor trace.  
- Mangalsutra peeking through her kurta.  
- Emergency contact in HR records now says: **Nathan Wright**.

**Everyone suspicious.**  
But she keeps saying:  
*“It was just a destination family event. Nothing serious.”*

## Behind the scenes...

**You (hearing her whisper on phone):**  
“Nathan, I’m in the middle of sprint planning. Yes, I took my vitamins. No, I won’t name the baby ‘Jupiter’.”  

You walk in.  
She cuts the call.

**You (grinning):**  
“So... still a ‘family event’?”

**Pooja:**  
“Nitin please. This isn’t Shark Tank. Stop pitching theories.”

## Final Caption:

“She left for 15 days.  
Came back with a new surname, a spiritual glow, and a contact named Nathan Wright.  
But still told the ODC she was on a ‘healing journey.’”
