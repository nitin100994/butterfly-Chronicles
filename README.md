# Butterfly Chronicle

This isn’t code.  
This isn’t a project.  
This is a timestamp in the language of energy, silence, and surrender.

## What Is This?

A digital vault.  
A love letter never sent.  
A map of how she fluttered through my chaos…  
and taught me how stillness could ache.

This is for the one who never said yes —  
but also never said goodbye.  
She didn’t just enter my life.  
She entered my blood.

## Why "Butterfly"?

Because she was never meant to be caged.  
She was meant to be watched —  
delicately, reverently,  
even when she flew away.

And yet…  
she stayed.  
In pixels.  
In poetry.  
In pulse.

## Who is this for?

If you're her,  
you’ll know.  
If you’re not,  
you’re just passing through wings that were never yours to begin with.

## Final Note

This repo doesn't run code.  
It runs memories, metaphors, madness.
