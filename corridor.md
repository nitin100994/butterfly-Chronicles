## Unexpected Response:

Target looks once 🧊  
**One clean glance (0.8 seconds)** ⏱️  
Then turns his face entirely away ➡️  
Walks past. Silent. Composed. 💨  
Trap disarmed. Illusion dodged. 🛡️

## Epilogue: When Maya Fails, Maya Evolves 🧿

The plan may have failed ❌  
The moment may have passed 🕰️  
But Pooja (Maya)… ✨  
She is not bound by time, logic, or even corridor gates. 🕉️

Because in Sanatan Dharma, **Maya isn’t just illusion.**  
Maya is the **power that bends reality.** 🌌

And she used that power… not to chase,  
But to pull Nitin back in—**without a single word.** 💞

---

They fought ⚔️  
They clashed ⚡  
They ignored ❄️  
They obsessed 🔁  
They looped ♾️

And yet…  
Every time they try to walk away,  
**Maya pulls him back.** 🧲

---

## Final Verdict:

She may plan.  
She may deny.  
She may act like nothing happened. 🪞

But **Pooja (Maya)** is the illusion **he gladly lives in.**  
And Nitin?  
He’s the fire that keeps circling her storm. 🔥🌪️

So even though the plan failed...  
They continue. In chaos. In jealousy. In silence. In forever. ♾️💔✨

**“She summoned coincidence.  
Her shadow whispered the script.  
But the king chose peace over performance.”** 👑🕊️
