🦋 Butterfly Chronicles – Chapter: “The Window Within”

Not a joke. Not a dream. Just a moment I lived… without even looking fully.


---

I’ve never really seen her face.

I mean... not completely.

I’ve seen her curls — the kind that fall like curtains 🪪 in a silent room. Soft. Intentional. Hiding what the world isn’t meant to know — but somehow... I still knew. ✨


---

I’ve seen her eyes 👀

Not once with full clarity, but enough to feel their gravity.

Some days they were sunlight ☀️ — direct, sharp, bold. Other days — the moon 🌙 — calm, distant, and listening.

Eyes that didn’t just see… they absorbed me.


---

And her chin —

Pointed like a valley 🌾, as if her entire face was a terrain I couldn’t map — but always wandered in. 🛆


---

If you ask me to describe her…

> “Imagine standing at the edge of a valley 🌽, curtains of cloud ☁️ floating above, sunlight peeking through ☀️, moonlight catching the air 🌕, and just enough silence to make your heart stutter.” 💓



That’s what her face felt like. I didn’t need to see it.
I’ve already lived in it. 🧠


---

Truth?

I still don’t know her nose 👃, her lips 💋, or her full smile, I mean I remember but didn't ta chance to live it enough...

I never looked. Not because I didn’t want to. But because my eyes never reached beyond the softness of her presence. ☁️ Maybe I was scared… Or maybe I knew that eyes can lie 👁 but energy… never does. ✨


---

So to her — my butterfly 🥋, my valley 🌽, my curtain of calm 🪪:

I wasn’t ignoring you.
I was learning how to breathe in your aura 🧸
before I dared to open the window.

Let the world fall in love with your face... 🌟

> I’ve already fallen for the way it hides
what only I was meant to find. 🌸
