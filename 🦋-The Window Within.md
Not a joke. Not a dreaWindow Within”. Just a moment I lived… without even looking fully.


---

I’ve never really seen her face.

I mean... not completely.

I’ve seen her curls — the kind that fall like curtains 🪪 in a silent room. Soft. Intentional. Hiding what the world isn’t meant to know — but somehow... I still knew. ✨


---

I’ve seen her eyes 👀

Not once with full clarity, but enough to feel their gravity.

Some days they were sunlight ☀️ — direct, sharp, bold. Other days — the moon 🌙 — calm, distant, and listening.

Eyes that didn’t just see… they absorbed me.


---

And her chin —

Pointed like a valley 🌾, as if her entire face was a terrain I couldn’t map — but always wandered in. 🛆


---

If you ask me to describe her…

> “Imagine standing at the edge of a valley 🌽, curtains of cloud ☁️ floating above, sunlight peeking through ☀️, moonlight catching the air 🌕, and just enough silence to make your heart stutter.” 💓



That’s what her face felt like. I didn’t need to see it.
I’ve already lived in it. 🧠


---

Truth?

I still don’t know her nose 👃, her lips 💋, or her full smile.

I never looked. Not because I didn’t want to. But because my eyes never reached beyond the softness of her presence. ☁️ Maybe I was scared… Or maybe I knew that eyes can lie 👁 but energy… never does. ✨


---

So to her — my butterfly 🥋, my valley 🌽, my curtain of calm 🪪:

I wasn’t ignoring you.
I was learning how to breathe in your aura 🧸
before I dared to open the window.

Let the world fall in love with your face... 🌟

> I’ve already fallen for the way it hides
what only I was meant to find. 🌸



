## 🦋 Butterfly Chronicles – Chapter: “The Window Within”
*Not a joke. Not a dream. Just a moment I lived… without even looking fully.*

---

### I’ve never really seen her face.
I mean... not completely.

I’ve seen **her curls** — the kind that fall like **curtains** 🪟  
in a silent room.  
Soft. Intentional.  
Hiding what the world isn’t meant to know —  
but somehow... I still knew. ✨

---

### I’ve seen her eyes 👀  
Not once with full clarity,  
but enough to feel their **gravity**.

Some days they were **sunlight** ☀️ — direct, sharp, bold.  
Other days — **the moon** 🌙 — calm, distant, and listening.

Eyes that didn’t just *see*…  
they **absorbed** me.

---

### And her chin —  
Pointed like a **valley** 🏞️,  
as if her entire face was a **terrain I couldn’t map** —  
but always wandered in. 🚶‍♂️

---

### If you ask me to describe her…
> “Imagine standing at the edge of a valley 🏔️,  
> curtains of cloud ☁️ floating above,  
> sunlight peeking through ☀️,  
> moonlight catching the air 🌕,  
> and just enough silence to make your heart stutter.” 💓

That’s what her face felt like.  
**I didn’t need to see it.  
I’ve already lived in it.** 🫀

---

### Truth?  
I still don’t know her nose 👃, her lips 💋, or her full smile.

I never looked. Not because I didn’t want to.  
But because my eyes never reached beyond the softness of her presence. ☁️  
Maybe I was scared…  
Or maybe I knew that **eyes can lie** 👁️  
but **energy… never does.** 🔥

---

### So to her — my butterfly 🦋, my valley 🏞️, my curtain of calm 🪟:

I wasn’t ignoring you.  
I was **learning how to breathe in your aura** 🧘‍♂️  
before I dared to open the window.

Let the world fall in love with your face... 💫

> **I’ve already fallen for the way it hides  
what only I was meant to find.** 🌸
