## Scene: ODC Chill Zone

Pooja walks in with a baby wrapped in a designer blanket.  
Custom bottle. Little logo on the bib that says “GrowThHackz”.  

**Colleague:**  
“Pooja… is that a *baby* in branded merch?”

**Pooja (adjusting glasses):**  
“No yaar… meet my **MVP** – Minimum Viable *Pihu*.  
I’m testing a childcare-tech model. Real-time growth analytics. Patent pending.”

## Scene: Product Demo

**Pooja (pitching to HR + confused interns):**  
“We’re disrupting the way India views parenting.  
This isn’t a child. It’s a *founder journey*.”

**Intern:**  
“Why does it cry every time Nitin leaves the room?”

**Pooja:**  
“That’s a location-based alert API. Still in beta.”

**You (jokingly):**  
“So I’m like the angel investor?”

**Pooja (grinning but hiding it):**  
“No, you’re the burn rate.”

## Scene: Investor Call – Baby Screams in Background
