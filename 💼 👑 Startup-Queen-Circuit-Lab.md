# ❤️ Pooja Chronicles – Episode 01: Startup Queen in the Circuit Lab

> _“Presenting: HeartBits – The World’s First Emotion-Powered IoT Device”_

---

## 🎬 Scene

Engineering seminar hall.  
Pooja in a red kurti (red = startup alert 🔴), heart pendant, sharp eyeliner.  
Crowd? Professors, classmates, 2 sleepy jury members, and a suspicious guy in the back (who turns out to be a VC investor). 😏

## 🧠 Slide 1 – Project Title

**HeartBits: A Mood-to-Device Sync System using IoT & Emotion AI**  
_“Why click buttons when your heart can speak?”_

---

## 🧪 Slide 2 – Demo

She plugs in a heart-shaped circuit board.  
Her smartwatch detects her pulse.  
Lights in the room turn **pink** when she blushes. 😂💡  
Everyone: *what the hell?*

---

## 🎭 Pooja says

> “Imagine a home that plays *sad songs* when you miss someone,  
> lights up *fairy lights* when you’re in love,  
> and locks the fridge when you feel *bored + hungry*.” 🍕💔😂

Richa, her friend, mouth wide open:  
**“Bro, are we still doing college projects or Shark Tank now?”** 🦈

---

## 💼 Investor Move

Then she winks at the mysterious guy in the back:

> **“The prototype cost is just ₹4999 per device.  
> Investors? You may ping after the viva.”** 😎💸

---

## 💬 Whispered Side Talk

Some guy whispers:  
> _“Bro, she’s not just submitting her project.  
> She’s launching her career.”_

Another girl:  
> _“And maybe launching someone's heartbreak too.”_ 💘💔

---

## 🎤 Final Slide

**Tagline:**  
> _“HeartBits: You may lie with words, but your BPM never lies.”_

She smiles, unplugs, and walks out.  
VC guy follows. Professors are still staring at the light that turned red when someone in the room stared too long at her. 🌡️😂

---

## 🔚 Outro Thought

> *Pooja didn’t just pass her final year.  
> She passed the audition for life.*  
> *Because this wasn’t a project.  
> It was a product of her own dreams… wired to her heart.* ❤️💡
